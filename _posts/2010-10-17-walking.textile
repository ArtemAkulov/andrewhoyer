h2. Idea(s) and Inspiration:

h2. Structure:

When I first started working on the walking man, I didn't really know where it was going to go so I ended up going through several iterations of markup for the actual skeleton. But in each iteration the css and overall structure of the man got better and better, so I think it worked out for the best.

The key idea behind all of this is the fact that a css transformation applied to an element also applies to all of its children. Without this, I would have had to use all kinds of math to figure out how to make the joints match up. Instead all that work is done for me, all I have to do is animate each limb independently.
