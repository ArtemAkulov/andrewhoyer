	<h3>What's this all about?</h3>
	<p>On <a href='http://graffitiresearchlab.com/'>GRL's website</a>, there was a project called "<a href='http://graffitiresearchlab.com/?page_id=34#video'>the Drip Sessions</a>" where they would use light to paint graffiti on the sides of entire buildings and structures. I just wanted to create something like that... except with code for the web.</p>

	<h3>Recoding:</h3>
	<p>For a while this program wouldn't work with opera and I couldn't figure out why. So instead of tinkering around and wasting time I decided it would be easier to just recode the entire thing. This is about 50 minutes of work sped up so it only takes 3 minutes. Music: Meow by Motohiro Nakashima.</p>
